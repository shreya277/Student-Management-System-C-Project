The Student Management System is a console-based application developed in C++, designed to handle student records efficiently. It provides various functionalities such as inserting, viewing, searching, deleting, updating, and sorting student records. Additionally, it offers statistical insights into student data.

This project is useful for learning fundamental C++ concepts such as:

1.Arrays for storing student records.

2.File handling to store data persistently.

3.Input/output operations via the console.

4.Menu-driven programming to navigate functionalities.

üîπ Features of the Student Management System
Feature	Description
Insert Student	Adds a new student record with details like ID, Name, Age, and Course.
View All Students	Displays a list of all students currently stored.
Search Student	Finds a student record based on their name or ID.
Delete Student	Removes a student record from the system.
Update Student	Modifies details of an existing student.
Sort Records	Sorts student records alphabetically by name.
Statistics	Displays insights like total students and average age.
üîπ Language & Interface
1Ô∏è‚É£ Programming Language: C++
The system is implemented in C++, making use of:

Arrays for storing student data.

Functions to structure the program.

File Handling (Optional) to save and retrieve records persistently.

Conditional Statements & Loops to control program flow.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Interface: Command Line (CLI)
The application runs in a terminal/console.

It presents a menu-driven interface, where the user selects options by entering numbers.

üîπ Data Representation in the System
Each student record consists of:

Student ID ‚Üí Unique identifier for each student.

Name ‚Üí String representing the student‚Äôs full name.

Age ‚Üí Integer value indicating the student‚Äôs age.

Course ‚Üí String representing the course the student is enrolled in.

A struct or array of objects is typically used to store these records.

üîπ Functional Breakdown
1Ô∏è‚É£ Insert Student
Prompts the user to enter details (ID, Name, Age, Course).

Stores the data in an array.

2Ô∏è‚É£ View All Students
Displays all stored records.

Prints details in a tabular format.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Search Student
Allows searching by name or ID.

Uses string comparison (e.g., strcmp() for C-style strings or == for std::string).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Delete Student
Finds the student by ID.

Removes the record and shifts remaining records to maintain order.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Update Student
Locates the student by ID.

Modifies their details (e.g., name, age, or course).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Sort Records
Sorts records alphabetically by name.

Uses Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or std::sort().

7Ô∏è‚É£ Show Statistics
Displays:

Total students

Average age

Most popular course (Optional)
